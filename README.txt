This is a shooting game developed in Java. 

The game has five roles, a Hero, waters, fires, fireballs, and pants. The Hero can shoot waters to kill a fireball and a fire; fires eject fireballs. When a pant is hit by a fireball, it turns into a fire also ejecting fireballs. When a fireball is hit by a water, both are terminated; when a fire is hit by multiple waters, it can be eliminated. 

The player manipulates the Hero to protect the pants from being hit by fireballs. The Hero can move up/down and left/right with the “W””S””A””D” keys or move toward the mouse cursor. Waters are fired by Hero when SPACE key is pressed. 


The game currently has three levels. Each level have different number of each roles. When all the pants turn into fire, or if the Hero is hit by a fireball, the player loses the game. If the Hero eliminates all fires, the game is won and advances to the next level.
